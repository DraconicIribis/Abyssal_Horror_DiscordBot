# Abyssal_Horror_DiscordBot
# A Discord bot that was started in early 2017 to test out Python. Worked on many years in the Repl.it web-based IDE. Now updated to work in the current year.

NOTE: Due to an unknown cause, the way in which the bot imports libraries randomly changed without user editing. The bot refuses to download the needed imports as of now. Worked through multiple possible solutions and none worked.

Lots of credit goes to multiple discord users and friends that have greatly helped me on this project. Thank you for your help in this project.

The bot provides:
 - An XP tracking service, with individual levels and roles automatically given based on XP
 - Multiple games and entertainment commands
 - Comedic commands that spruce up a discord server

Bot token has been removed from all code.
