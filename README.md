# Abyssal_Horror_DiscordBot
# A Discord bot that was started in early 2017 to test out Python. Worked on many years in the Repl.it web-based IDE. Now deprecated.

NOTE:
Abyssal Horror is now offline. Due to deprecations in Python code, the bot can no longer run adequately.
Discord has been updated with multiple "breaking changes" since I last worked on this bot, which run deep in the code.
 - Last edit was made in 2020 by me.
 - Friends have updated it a little bit late 2020 and early 2021

Lots of credit goes to multiple discord users and friends that have greatly helped me on this project. Thank you for your help in this project.
